example file for given contract_id


start with this:

[
	{
		contract_id,
		token_id,
		maker_id,
		taker_id,
		amount,
		updated_at
	}
]

results = 385 rows

load the old contract json

check existing file and do nothing if total_offers is the same as old file

if difference in offers then we regen file

example: rows = 421

for each token that has new offers push offer, update summary

once all tokens are updated, update entire file summary

need this:

{
	total_offers: 385,

	summary: {
		'minAmount': '5000000000000000000000000',
		'maxAmount': '25000000000000000000000000',
		supply: '',
	},
	tokens: {
		'cool-nft:345': {
			summary: {
				
			},
			offers: [...]
		},
		'cool-nft:32125': {
			summary: {
				
			},
			offers: [...]
		}
	}
}


Nice to have
