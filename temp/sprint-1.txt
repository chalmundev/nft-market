Contracts list updates (RouteAllContracts)

Goal: add autocomplete for name/contract_id

- only fetch new contracts
- grab 1 token example media for contract
- final data for each contract
{
	title, symbol, contract_id, media (in mintbase this will be json, it's fine I'll deal with it frontend)
}
- if you can't find media, leave it null or undefined (I'll deal frontend)

- ETA tonight

Flow Charts

- Update to simplified flow

we now only really have these cases:

(1) Owner sets price by nft_approve (new offer)
- makers cannot under bid
- maker bids equal or more and transfer happens
- owner can re-approve for a higher amount
- owner can remove their own offer at any time

(2) Maker sets price (new offer)
- makers cannot under bid
- owner can approve for a higher amount (go to 1)
- owner can accept offer
