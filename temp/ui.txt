Email to designers:

We are building an NFT Marketplace so we need a textual logo (font choice basically), colors and some UI Elements.

Finally, we need some help on a few screens and minimal UX but not exhaustive to the whole site. We are experienced app builders with some UX background.

Details:
- style - fonts, colors, shadows/weight, borders, shapes of elements (corner radius etc...)
- UI elements - we can send detailed list tomorrow with more examples and sketches
- some screens & UX - not exhaustive but perhaps the home screen with featured NFTs and some of the listing/offer screens

This is a short time. But it is a minimalist project with future potential post hackathon. We have been approached by investors who want to back the project as a DAO already.

We want it to be fun and easy for you as well.

Proposed phases and timeline:

1. Jan 19th - 21st

We suggest to start with 3 examples of style choices. Only a font + minimal colors and a UI sketch of and NFT listing for example under Trending Auctions here: https://foundation.app/

Then we can do a check-in on the general direction and make sure things are on the right path?

2. Jan 26th - 28th

Finish style, UI elements. We provide some small feedback. We provide sketches of a few screens we need help with.

3. Feb 2nd - 4th

Final submission.

Payment details:

We will pay in NEAR tokens. Please create NEAR wallet here: wallet.near.org

If we win something in hackathon we will pay a bonus as well.

Examples we like:

The feeling we like:
- clean and minimal, no overuse of cards, borders or shadows
- large gradients, grainy filter
- 80s / retrowave colors
- sharp edges with minimal but smart use of rounded corners
