Frontend: 

For each NFT contract: 
- list all NFT tokens (in some sort of infinite scrolling page). 
    - NFTs with offers are at the top by default.
    - NFTs with no offers are after. 
    - You can sort by filter offers (maker = taker), default offers, and no offers.
    - You can sort by price high - low and also sort by updated_at. 
    - You can search for NFTs by token ID, title, or description.
