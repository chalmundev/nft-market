DONE

TEST CASE?

Alice makes an offer
Bob approves his nft and makes an offer with an amount that is > Alice's offer
-> Bob replaces alice as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount

DONE
TEST CASE - YES
Bob approves his nft and makes an offer with an amount
Alice makes a "matching" offer that is < amount of Bob's offer if Bob's offer is not u128::MAX
-> panic

Open for bids (no introductory price)

DONE
TEST CASE - YES
amount = u128::MAX is considered (open bidding in UI, nothing to do in contract)

Bob approves his nft and opens it for bidding??? amount = u128::MAX
Alice makes an offer (any amount)
-> Alice replaces bob as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount
-> Bob replaces bob as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount
-> Carol replaces bob as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount
