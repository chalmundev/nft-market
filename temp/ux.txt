Bob is taker (seller/owner)

DONE

TODO

Similar cases

DONE (automatically handled with existing logic)
Alice makes an offer
Bob approves his nft and makes an offer with an amount that is <= Alice's offer
- with auto_transfer: -> nft_transfer_payout -> resolve_offer
- without auto_transfer: -> accept_offer -> nft_transfer_payout -> resolve_offer

DONE
Bob approves his nft and makes an offer with an amount
Alice makes an offer that is >= amount of Bob's offer
-> nft_transfer_payout -> resolve_offer

Similar cases

DONE
Alice makes an offer
Bob approves his nft and makes an offer with an amount that is > Alice's offer
-> Bob replaces alice as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount

DONE
Bob approves his nft and makes an offer with an amount
Alice makes a "matching" offer that is < amount of Bob's offer if Bob's offer is not u128::MAX
-> panic

DONE
Open for bids (no introductory price)
amount = u128::MAX is considered (open bidding in UI, nothing to do in contract)

Bob approves his nft and opens it for bidding??? amount = u128::MAX
Alice makes an offer (any amount)
-> Alice replaces bob as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount
-> Bob replaces bob as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount
-> Carol replaces bob as offer.maker_id and replaces offer.amount
