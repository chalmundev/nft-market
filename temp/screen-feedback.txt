Background on NEAR NFTs

Every token has:
- token_id
- title (optional but we will use token_id if it's not available)
- contract_id (it belongs to)
- image


Overall
- we'll remember if they collapsed price history/change sections so they can navigate easier

Contract

- PRICE CHANGE (last 5 price changes for the contract)
	- From is actually the token name (or token_id)
